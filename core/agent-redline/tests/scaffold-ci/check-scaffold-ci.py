Pattern check: any scaffold.md YAML block that runs the reporter
(`python scripts/agent-redline-report.py`) MUST follow the
exit-code-capture pattern. Catches the class of bug Pallium hit:
agent copies the scaffold's reporter step verbatim, GitHub Actions
runs the block under `bash -e`, the reporter exits 1 on a normal
RED verdict, the step fails, the sticky-comment + enforce steps
are skipped, and shadow-mode signal silently disappears.

Two flow modes; each block must follow ONE consistent pattern:

  PR-driven flow (`on: pull_request:`):
    - `set +e` (executable line, not just a comment)
    - `EXIT=$?` capture
    - publish `exit_code=$EXIT` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    - sticky-comment step (uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment)
    - enforce step gating on `"$EXIT" == "2"`

  push-driven flow (`on: push:`):
    - `set +e` (executable line)
    - `EXIT=$?` capture
    - publish `exit_code=$EXIT` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    - NO sticky-comment step (no PR to comment on)
    - $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY append step (run-page surface)
    - reporter call passes `--flow-mode push` so checkpoint text is
      rendered as a review obligation on the commit (CODEOWNER /
      label phrasing doesn't apply on a direct push)
    - enforce step gates on `"$EXIT" != "0"` so GitHub's default
      workflow-failure email notification fires for both RED warnings
      and BOUNDARY_VIOLATION hard fails. agent-redline ships as its
      own workflow file; failing it does not fail other workflows in
      the repo.

Mode is detected from the same yaml block: `pull_request` vs `push:`
appears in the trigger / changed-files git diff invocation.

Exit codes:
  0 — every reporter run-block follows its mode's pattern
  1 — script error
  2 — at least one block is missing required pattern elements
