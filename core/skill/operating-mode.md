# operating-mode

For an in-scope change task when `agent-workflow.yaml` exists.

## Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Work Record** | One file per task, marker-bounded, holding structured state. Location configured by `agent-workflow.yaml`'s `workRecord.local.taskPath` (e.g. `.agent-workflow/tasks/{slug}.md`). |
| **Slug** | Persisted task identifier, or the branch-derived fallback. |
| **Compact shape** | Fast-path Work Record for `(Routine, Simple)` tasks. SPEC §7. |
| **Expanded shape** | Full §9.4 Work Record. Required for any classification other than `(Routine, Simple)`. |
| **Risk** | `Routine`, `Elevated`, `High`. Determines approvals, reviews, verification. |
| **Complexity** | `Simple`, `Moderate`, `Large`. Determines planning depth and recovery requirements. |
| **Checkpoint** | A workflow gate: Establish Context, Discover, Assess Risk, Plan/Review, Implement, Verify, Review the Result. |

## The loop

```
0. Apply request scope before config; return for standalone read-only analysis.
1. Read agent-workflow.yaml.
2. Use the supplied Work Record identity, or derive the slug from the branch.
3. Classify, then read or initialise the Work Record.
4. At each checkpoint, write then act.
5. Update State at transitions.
6. Update Implementation prose at checkpoint boundaries.
7. On stop or handoff: leave recovery state explicit.
```

## Step 1 — Read the config

Open `agent-workflow.yaml` and read:

- `workRecord.backend` — `local` (supported) or `jira` (not yet — stop).
- `workRecord.local.taskPath` — the per-task path template.
- `applicability.documentationOnly`, when present — load [`applicability.md`](core/templates/checkpoints/applicability.md) and evaluate it before deriving a slug. If exempt, follow that file's branch decision and return without a Work Record.

## Step 2 — Resolve the identity

When given `agent-workflow:<slug>`, invoke `python <trusted-install>/scripts/agent-workflow-check.py --repo-root <checkout> --resolve-work-record --work-record-ref agent-workflow:<slug>`. Use the supplied identity verbatim; never compare or fall back to the branch, and never create a competing record.

Otherwise run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, strip the first matching prefix from `slice/`, `feat/`, `feature/`, `fix/`, `bug/`, `chore/`, `demo/`, then replace remaining `/` with `-`. On a long-lived branch, stop unless it is the default and applicability passed.

## Step 3 — Classify, then read or initialise the Work Record

Decide classification before writing the file. Read [`templates/checkpoints/assess-risk.md`](templates/checkpoints/assess-risk.md) NOW — it carries the redline-verdict-to-Risk translation table and the engineering-judgment escape. The summary:

- **Risk** — `Routine` / `Elevated` / `High`. Derived from redline's pre-edit classification of the intended scope; may be raised by judgment, not lowered.
- **Complexity** — `Simple` / `Moderate` / `Large`.

| `(Risk, Complexity)` | Shape |
|---|---|
| `(Routine, Simple)` | Compact — fewer fields. Template: [`templates/work-record-routine.md`](templates/work-record-routine.md). |
| Anything else | Expanded — full §9.4 field set. Template: [`templates/work-record-expanded.md`](templates/work-record-expanded.md). |

Resolve `taskPath` with the slug. If it exists, parse it. On takeover/resume, confirm next action, constraints, and verification from the record, repo, and authoritative links; repair gaps before acting. If absent, copy the matching template. On parse failure, restore every field.

Surrounding prose holds Implementation, Evidence, and Result-review references.

## Step 4 — Walk the checkpoints

Write each field first, then act on it. Only when planning fields are populated may you begin implementation.

| Field(s) on compact | Field(s) on expanded | Checkpoint | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Outcome, Target, Scope, Constraints, Completion criteria | same | Establish Task Context | [`establish-context.md`](templates/checkpoints/establish-context.md) |
| (implicit) | Discovery | Discover | [`discover.md`](templates/checkpoints/discover.md) |
| Risk, Complexity, Reason | same | Assess Risk and Complexity | [`assess-risk.md`](templates/checkpoints/assess-risk.md) |
| Approach, Verification | Plan, Verification plan, Plan review, Approvals | Plan and Review | [`plan-and-review.md`](templates/checkpoints/plan-and-review.md) |
| (act on the plan) | (act on the plan) | Implement | [`implement.md`](templates/checkpoints/implement.md) |
| Verification | Verification plan | Verify | [`verify.md`](templates/checkpoints/verify.md) |
| (PR review) | (PR review) | Review the Result | [`review-result.md`](templates/checkpoints/review-result.md) |

If you re-classify mid-task, update Risk/Complexity and migrate the record's shape if needed. The checker blocks any record whose shape contradicts its classification.

## Step 5 — Update State at every transition

Allowed values:

- `Ready to implement` — planning fields written, coding not begun.
- `Blocked` (or `Blocked or returned to planning`) — stopped on assumption failure, scope question, or external blocker named in the Work Record.
- `Ready for review` — implementation done, verification ran, evidence reference is in surrounding prose.

Update as soon as the transition happens; don't batch at the end. A killed session that left State stale misleads the next agent.

## Step 6 — Update Implementation prose at every checkpoint transition

The next agent reads **Implementation prose** to recover what happened between Plan and Verify.

Update at every phase boundary:

- After Discover: name what you found that Outcome / Scope didn't anticipate.
- After Assess-Risk: if classification surprised you, note why.
- After Plan-and-Review (Elevated/High): the Plan + Plan-review fields ARE the update.
- During Implement: one-line entry per phase boundary in roughly chronological order. **Don't wait until the task is done.**
- At Verify: list actual checks and their results. Not a recap of the plan.

The `workrecord.commit_order` advisory predicate fires when the Work Record's first commit on a branch lands *after* the first code commit on the same branch — i.e., retroactive. Non-blocking; treat it as a signal to check whether recovery state was sacrificed.

## Delegating to subagents

Outcome-affecting subagents inherit this Work Record. Prompt them with:

1. Path to the Work Record (don't paraphrase; point at the file).
2. What the subagent should update on completion (Implementation prose, Evidence, State).
3. The scope boundary (parts of Scope it may touch; parts it may not).
4. Read-only vs material (read-only subagents report and don't update the record; material subagents update it).
5. Exact target checkout; use explicit shell workdir or absolute write targets. Relative `apply_patch` targets the session cwd, not a prose-assigned checkout.

When the subagent finishes, sanity-check the Work Record. If the subagent updated it, the record reflects the work done; if not, you update before declaring the step done.

### Clean-context delegation

Some checkpoints (Elevated Plan review, High-risk approval prep, pre-edit Risk classification when redline isn't pre-integrated) require a **clean-context subagent** — one with no context from the current planning conversation. Canonical mechanism:

- **In Claude Code / harnesses with a Task/Agent primitive:** spawn a subagent (e.g., `Task` tool, `subagent_type: "Explore"` for read-only review, or a custom agent type). Pass the Work Record path + relevant source paths + SPEC reference + the question. Do not paraphrase the Work Record into the prompt — point at the file so the subagent reads it fresh.
- **In harnesses without a subagent primitive:** open a fresh session and provide the same inputs (Work Record file, SPEC reference, source links). The fresh session IS the clean context.

The subagent's review prose lands under a `## Plan review` heading in the Work Record. The marker-block `Plan review:` field references that section (or the session id).

## Step 7 — Resolve review threads before merge

CI green is not "ready to merge." Before invoking the merge:

- Read the PR's inline review threads: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{N}/comments` (line-level threads, where bot findings live) and `gh pr view <N> --json reviews,reviewThreads` (review summaries + thread state). Top-level PR comments via `gh pr view --json comments` are separate.
- Reply to each thread that names a finding — either with the fix's commit hash, or a one-line rationale for declining. Use `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{N}/comments/{comment_id}/replies` to reply inline.
- Resolve the thread via GraphQL: `gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "..."}) { thread { isResolved } } }'`. The thread ID comes from `reviewThreads` in the earlier `gh pr view` call.
- Only then merge.

The repo SHOULD enable GitHub's `required_conversation_resolution` branch-protection rule so the platform refuses merge while threads are open. Bootstrap proposes it; the harness assumes it.

## Step 8 — Stop and handoff

Before ending a session, even if the task is not done:

- Update State to the correct value (most often `Blocked` with one-line reason, or leave `Ready to implement` if you haven't started).
- In surrounding prose, note: current branch, last good revision (`git rev-parse HEAD` when working tree is clean), what's unfinished, what the next agent should do first.
- Carry the exact source-item identity, Work Record identity, and resolved repository-relative path when known.
- Commit the Work Record update. Uncommitted state buys nothing if the session crashes.

## CI predicates surfaced at PR time

`workrecord.exists`, `workrecord.markers_present`, `risk.declared`, `complexity.declared`, `workrecord.shape_matches_classification`, `workrecord.routine_fields_present` (compact) / `workrecord.expanded_fields_present` (expanded), `workrecord.state_valid`.

A failing predicate names the cause in its detail. Fix the marker block, push again — the sticky verdict comment refreshes on the next CI run. The harness does not judge whether the prose is right, only whether the structure is well-formed.
